Tipi Analysis Project

Personality is an important factor that inherently affects the ways in which we think and make decisions. The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) is a tool used by psychologists to better identify different personality types that can affect behavior. It scores people on 5 key traits that have been found to be successful predictors of behavior in a number of situations (i.e. social media use, managing relationships, financial decision-making, etc.).Our final project will be a program that provides the user with a GUI that presents a series of questions using TIPI. These questions will be used to evaluate the user’s personality. The results will then be visualized on the screen and the user can export them as a report.  The results will include the user’s scores for the big 5 personality traits and descriptions of each, as well as a comparison to cohort norm values as per the TIPI webpage.
