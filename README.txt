The class LogicCheck holds the method which is to be unit tested.  It is stored in a standalone class for ease of testing.  The JUnitTest class LogicCheckTest is the unit test which tests the method method LogicCheck.  This method exists within the TipiLogic class, but was cut and pasted to the standalone class to more easily facilitate the unit test.
